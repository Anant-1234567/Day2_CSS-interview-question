    <h1>Day2 css Interview Question & Answer</h1>
    1) What is box-sizing?<br><br>
    Ans:- Box-sizing property defines how the width and height gets applied on an element.<br>
          there are two properties for box-sizing<br>
          (I)Content-box<br>
          (II)border-box<br><br>
          (I)Content-box:- in this case the actual width of the box will be equal to the border and padding and width of the box ( Actual width : width + border + padding ).This is also called default value.<br><br>
          (II)border-box:- in this case the actual width will be equal to the width of the box itself. Means if we will increase the padding or border of the box then it will not increase the width of the box.<br><br>
    2)What is animation delay?<br><br>
    Ans:- It is a sub-property of CSS animation. It defines how long the animation has to wait before starting. Using the animation-delay property, you define the delay by specifying the number of seconds or milliseconds it should take before playing.<br><br>
    3)Which property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid?<br><br>
    Ans:- grid-column-start and grid-column-end property can be used to merge cells vertically. It also has a shorthand i.e., grid-column: start/end. Remember these properties are applicable only to child elements not to parent elements.<br><br>
    4)Which property you will use to merge cells horizontally in grid?<br><br>
    Ans:- grid-row-start and grid-row-end property can be used to merge cells horizontally. It also has a shorthand i.e., grid-row: grid-row-start/grid-row-end;<br><br>
    5)What is Box-Model?<br><br>
    Ans:- The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.<br><br>
    6) what is the difference between display none and visibility hidden?<br><br>
    Ans:-display: none;<br>
                   The display: none property is used to hide elements without deleting them. It does not take up any space.
                   In this case, the tag is removed from the page, which allows other elements to fill in.<br><br>
        visibility: hidden;<br>
                   The visibility: hidden property also hides an element, but affects the layout i.e., it takes up the space.
                   The element is hidden from view but not the page flow.
